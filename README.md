### Front-End 
... was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The front-end was written in Rect.js with the use of auxiliary libraries:
"axios", "gh-pages", "react-dom", "react-router-dom", "slugify"
The use of Hooks and States made the task easier, for styling I used a modular connection with a style file.

### Back-End
... was bootstrapped with [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) and files on gh-repository [Bitbucket-Node](https://github.com/Mishka31/bitbucket-node.git).

In my opinion, separating the backend and frontend into different repositories makes it easier and faster to work. At the same time, I refreshed my understanding of deploying and connecting to the Monoi DB database. No additional steps are required to launch the backend repository. The backend was written with Node/js and Express.js
CRUD technology was used to write the database

### Available Scripts in Front-End

Runs the app in the development mode.\
